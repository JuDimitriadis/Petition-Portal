# Karen's Petition Portal
![Karen's Portal Logo](https://auspic.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/7sI1K2aHlgCjKk91XqVV.jpeg) 

This page is a petition portal inspired by the meme Karen, where every Karen can register, check available petitions, and sign them. Users can also check who else has signed it, edit their profile, change passwords and delete signatures.
It was also the first complex project that I developed by myself during the Spiced Academy Bootcamp, and the main requirement was to develope it using Express and Handlebars.

## Functionalities

- Register/Login page;
- Slide in Menu bar;
- Petitions: show all petitions available to sign;
- Signing: show Title, description, and field to allow the user to sign it 
- My signatures: show the Title and signature image from all signed petitions. Users can also delete signatures from this page
- My account: shows user profile information and allows users to edit their profile and change passwords.
- List of signers: user can see a list of everyone who has also signed a petition, with *Name, age, and City*. It also allows the user to open a second list filtered by City.
